# PEARC20

All tutorials at PEARC20 were shortened to half-day (~4 hrs), so the resulting tutorial is shorter than our planned full-day (~8 hrs).  If you are interested in the full-day tutorial, we presented it at [Gateways2020](https://github.com/XSEDE/Container_Tutorial/tree/main/Gateways2020) and a few other conferences going forward.  The materials in the [PEARC20 directory](https://github.com/XSEDE/Container_Tutorial/tree/master/PEARC20) have been organized in order of how they were originally presented:
