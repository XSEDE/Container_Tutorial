# XCRI Presents: Deep Dive into Constructing Containers for Scientific Computing and Gateways

## Abstract
In recent years, using containers has been rapidly gaining traction as a solution to lower the barriers to using more software on HPC and cloud resources. However, significant barriers still exist to actually doing this in practice, particularly for well-established community codes which expect to run on a particular operating system version or resource. Additional barriers exist for researchers unfamiliar with containerization technologies. While many beginner tutorials are available for building containers, they often stop short of covering the complexities that can arise when containerizing scientific computing software. The goal of this full-day tutorial is to demonstrate and work through building and running non-trivial containers with users. We will containerize community scientific software, exhibit how to share with a larger community via a container registry, and then run on a completely separate HPC resource, with and without the use of a Science Gateway. The subject matter will be approachable for intermediate to advanced users, and is expected to be of interest to a diverse audience including researchers, support staff, and teams building science gateways.

## PEARC20

All tutorials at PEARC20 were shortened to half-day (~4 hrs), so the resulting tutorial is shorter than our planned full-day (~8 hrs).  If you are interested in the full-day tutorial, we will be presenting it at Gateways2020 and sharing the materials here upon completion.  The materials in the [PEARC20 directory](https://github.com/XSEDE/Container_Tutorial/tree/master/PEARC20) have been organized in order of how they were originally presented:

1. **Introduction to Containers** by [Jeremy Fischer](https://github.com/jlf599), Indiana University
2. **Simple Container Creation** by [Sanjana Sudarshan](https://github.com/sanjanasudarshan), Indiana University
3. **Docker to Singularity Conversion** by [Peter Vaillancourt](https://github.com/sk8forether), Cornell University
4. **Exercise 1 - Build, Share, and Run a Container** by [Eric Coulter](https://github.com/ECoulter), Indiana University
5. **Docker MATLAB Runtime Container** by [Stephen Bird](https://github.com/stebird), Indiana University
6. **Containerization: Best Practices and Advanced Topics** by [Peter Vaillancourt](https://github.com/sk8forether)
7. **Science Gateways** by [Suresh Marru](https://github.com/smarru), Indiana University

## Gateways2020

### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This Tutorial will be presented as a full-day Tutorial at Gateways2020.  The half-day tutorial we presented at PEARC20 will be our starting point for this one, so feel free to check out those materials in the meantime.
