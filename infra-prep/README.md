#Infrastructure Preparation

The scripts in this directory are used to create the infrastructure needed for this 
tutorial.

They will not be suitable for use outside of the Jetstream cloud, and are highly idiosyncratic!

The tests from previous workshops may not work with the current infrastructure, due to 
updates in options for configuring the Docker and Singularity environments.
